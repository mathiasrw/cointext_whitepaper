# CoinText white paper

The dokument is generated with Madoko (think markdown that fell in love with Latex)

The generated PDF is in the `out` folder. To edit and regenerate the PDF please do the following:

* Fork this repo
* Go to https://www.madoko.net/editor.html
* In the top left click the folder icon
* Select `Open`
* Select `Github` and connect with your credentials
* Select the repo you just forked
* Select `Master` and click `whitepaper.mdk` to open
* If you change any text a preview can imidiatly be seen at the right side
* When you are ready to see the PDF: go to the folder icon in the top left and select `Generate PDF document`


To save your changes to your github repo please go to the folder icon in the top left and select `Synchronise` - remember to fill out a commit message. I suggest only syncing `whitepaper.mdk` and `whitepaper.pdf`
